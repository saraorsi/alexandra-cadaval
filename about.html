                        I have been incredibly fortunate to share a connection with the traditional world, in its many guises. Firstly, through music, before ritual, ornamentation, and then to weaving. I have created platforms and projects aimed at helping, even if only 
to a small degree, some of these art forms, bringing them to the fore to be seen in their authenticity. If we look at intangible cultural heritage today there are increasingly more forms being classified. At the same time, globalisation is placing 
our world and its traditions at major risk. Their history, and ours, is disappearing without a trace.</p> 
<p>The projects I have created have all come from the heart. They have arisen spontaneously, through a powerful connection 
to each of these artists. Little by little, in the natural development of their own creation, I will share more and more of them, in the hope that you will feel the same connection too.

                        With a degree in Cultural Industries and co-director of the World Sacred Spirit Festival, Alexandra boasts vast 
                        international experience in the arts and in artistic production, having worked with traditional and contemporary artist 
                        and with disadvantaged populations.

                    <p>
                        Since gaining her degree in Cultural Industries from City, University of London, in 2005, Alexandra has been devoted to music and the arts. Working closely with renowned French artistic director Alain Weber, she has directed and organised music and cultural festivals, including Festival Évora Clássica, Festival Os Orientais, and Festival Évora Africa, 
all in Portugal; and the Sacred Spirit Festival, in India.

                    <p>
                        Her experience working with cultural heritage alongside Alain Weber has helped her develop skills with a view to creating platforms for rural art forms and nurtured her passion for traditional cultures. Nowadays, having worked extensively in Africa, she has also developed a deep passion for African contemporary art, creating several international exhibitions.
