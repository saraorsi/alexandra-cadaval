              <p>Two vibrant UNESCO status Intangible Cultural Heritage practices and expressions, the Ndebele art of wall painting
                and Indian weaving technique known as Dhurrie, join forces in a colourful series of tapestries based on the work
                of acclaimed Ndebele art proponent Dr. Esther Mahlangu.<br />
                The meeting of these two disparate artforms has been lovingly facilitated by Alexandra de Cadaval, as an enterprise
                of her art projects. Part love affair, part business venture, the energy behind the project stems not only from Alexandra’s
                passion for the art of ornamentation and her multi-layered experience of world culture, but also from a special bond
                she has formed with the South African artist.</p>

              <p>Esther Mahlangu is a prominent member of the Ndebele community. One of the leading figures of Ndebele painting,
                her work reflects the deep-rooted ancestral traditions of the Ndebele people, where the artistic heritage of ceremonial
                beadwork and subsequently decorative wall painting is transmitted from mother to daughter. Representing rites of passage,
                these brightly-coloured geometric abstract yet patterned works decorate the walls of traditional Ndebele houses.
                Mahlangu is the first Ndebele artist to move from walls to canvas, and indeed to bring this artform into the wider world.
                Her work was first brought from Africa to Europe (Paris) for an exhibition entitled Magiciens de la Terre, in itself a project
                to discover ancestral art and artists from ‘indigenous cultures’ around the globe and introduce them to a wider public.</p>

              <p>Alexandra de Cadaval first met Esther Mahlangu in 2017, when she visited her village in South Africa. Having developed
                a great interest in the art of ornamentation in sub-Saharan Africa, Alexandra was drawn inevitably towards Ndebele wall
                painting traditions and Esther Mahlangu, after initially spending time studying similar practices in Burkina Faso. In a
                glorious coincidence, Alexandra invited André Magnin to curate her African Passion exhibition (2018) in the Cadaval Palace,
                in Evora, Portugal, the same man who was charged with searching for African artists for the Magiciens de la Terre in Paris
                and who has been responsible for placing Esther on the international art map.</p>
              <p>Fascinated as much by her paintings as by her magical aura, Alexandra was delighted to be able to make the most of her
                curator’s unique relationship with Esther to invite her to come to Portugal, as part of the African Passion exhibition. During
                their four weeks together at the palace, Alexandra and Esther formed a bond that went beyond the beautiful mural in
                the palace courtyard, or the painted pillars outside the palace restaurant. Alexandra, urged on by a passion for tradition
                transmission projects, and with a desire to help foment artistic communities, suggested a project to translate Esther’s
                paintings into Dhurrie tapestries, thus helping preserve the 87-year-old artist’s legacy and let her paintings live on.</p>
